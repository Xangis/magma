Tuesday, February 22, 2019

https://github.com/Xangis/magma

Linux users:
Run "make std" in the src directory to compile the MUD and then run the "magma"
file that results.

Windows
Run MagmaMUD.exe in the /src directory.

Visual Studio 2005 (and newer):
Use the project file in the /src directory.  For earlier versions of Visual Studio
you will need to manually add all .c and .h files to a new project.  When we tested
this with Visual Studio 2008 it was able to convert and build the project without
any problems.


*Note:  This archive does contain a pre-built excutable file for Windows but not
        for Linux.  You will need to use the source code in /src to build one.
