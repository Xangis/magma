=== Clans code changes

The old clans code has been thrown out trough the window. The new code is such a
mix of several clan implementation's ideas i can't quite remind of them.
However i must say: it is very close to the SMAUG clans system tough a bit
more complex. Most clans code is in act_clan.c, but file load/saving is in
tables.c


=== The fundamental structures in memory are

++ The clans linked memory list ++

struct  clan_data
{
    CLAN_DATA * next;           /* next clan in list                    */
    char *      filename;       /* Clan filename                        */
    char *      who_name;       /* Clan who name                        */
    char *      name;           /* Clan name                            */
    char *      motto;          /* Clan motto                           */
    char *      description;    /* A brief description of the clan      */
    char *      overlord;       /* Head clan leader                     */
    char *      chieftain;      /* Second in command                    */
    int         pkills;         /* Number of pkills on behalf of clan   */
    int         pdeaths;        /* Number of pkills against clan        */
    int         mkills;         /* Number of mkills on behalf of clan   */
    int         mdeaths;        /* Number of clan deaths due to mobs    */
    int         illegal_pk;     /* Number of illegal pk's by clan       */
    int         score;          /* Overall score                        */
    int         clan_type;      /* See clan type defines                */
    int         subchiefs;      /* Number of subchiefs                  */
    int         clanheros;      /* Number of clanheros                  */
    int         members;        /* Number of clan members               */
    int         clanobj1;       /* Vnum of first clan obj (ring)        */
    int         clanobj2;       /* Vnum of second clan obj (shield)     */
    int         clanobj3;       /* Vnum of third clan obj (weapon)      */
    int         recall;         /* Vnum of clan's recall room           */
    int         donation;       /* Vnum of clan's donation pit          */
    int         class;          /* For guilds                           */
};


++ The player (pcdata) clan info data structures ++

	CLAN_DATA *ch->pcdata->clan	/* pointer to player's clan */
	int        ch->pcdata->rank	/* clan rank bits           */


	RANK_NONE		      0		/* Doesn't have a clan  */
	RANK_EXILED		      1		/* Exiled from a clan   */
	RANK_CLANSMAN		      2		/* Foot soldier         */
	RANK_CLANHERO		      3		/* Knight               */
	RANK_SUBCHIEF		      4		/* Knight Lord          */
	RANK_CHIEFTAIN		      5		/* Second in command    */
	RANK_OVERLORD		      6		/* Head clan leader     */

=== Rules & info on clan system

A clan may be of 4 types: regular (PKILL), no PKILL, Order or Guild like in
SMAUG.

However the rank system is more complex; (from top to bottom) you have 5 ranks:
Overlord, Chieftain, Subchief, Clanhero, Clansman.

There may only be 1 Overlord of course, he may "exile", "promote" and "demote"
his fellow clansmen.
Both the Overlord and Chieftain may "initiate" players into the clan. There may
only be 1 Chieftain.

But some rules are required in this chaos; so you need enough members to have
new officers:

Chieftain:	9 members required, max 1
Subchief:	6 members required, max unlimited
Clanhero:	3 members required, max unlimited
Clansman:	no limits, you may have as many foot soldiers has you want.

As they rise trough the ranks, clansmen get clan prizes:

Clan Ring:	upon promotion to Clanhero
Clan Shield:	upon promotion to Subchief
Clan Weapon:	upon promotion to Chieftain

Of course this system needs several improvements like clan score for example.
With added score you could get more rooms for your clan or a special
spec_healer type program for example.  Of course these limits are too small for
a large mud.  However since here we shouldn't have too many players (when and
if i get a place in a mud team) i find these limits reasonable.
