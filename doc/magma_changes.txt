------------------
Magma 3.07 Changes
------------------

- Changed Linux version so that MAGMA_HOME can be used to set the location of
  data directories. If not set the system will default to /usr/local/share.
- Added "version" admin command to show current magma version.
- Added -v or --version command line switch to print the version and exit.

------------------
Magma 3.06 Changes
------------------

- Switched build system to CMake instead of ugly makefiles.
- Removed AmigaTCP support, which has never been tested anyway.
- Changed Linux paths to use /usr/local/share for data and /usr/local/bin for binary.
  Data paths are also relative to executable so system-wide install or snapb-based
  install can find data files.

------------------
Magma 3.05 Changes
------------------

- Fixed some indentation issues that produced warnings on modern C compilers.
- Fixed some logic errors, such as the check whether a player can "tell" to another
  player on a different racewar side and an error in the mirror image spell.

------------------
Magma 3.04 Changes
------------------

- Fixed loading of solace.are, naytil.are, and crystal.are and added them to the
  AREA.LST file.  The only two original Envy 2.2 areas that do not load now are
  gods.are and descent.are.
- Bundled MakeZonesFast (MZF) and DikuEdit 3.10 with the distribution.  They
  can be found in the /editors directory.  Please note that areas built with
  DikuEdit will need to be assembled using the Makezone utility found in
  /area/convzone.
- Added a DOS version of Makezone to /area/convzone so assembling DikuEdit zones is
  no longer OS-dependent.

------------------
Magma 3.03 Changes
------------------

Added support for loading Envy 2.2 areas.  Flags are being converted from Envy
values to Magma values, but there's always the possibility of some strangeness
since the stock areas have not been thoroughly tested.  Please report any bugs
or glitches you find to the above email address.

In addition, the following bugs were fixed:
- Missing newbie items no longer causes creating a Human race character to crash
  the game.
- Missing spawn rooms no longer cause most race-class combinations to crash the
  game.
- The player file save directory is no longer incorrect on Windows.

All of these problems were caused by having Basternae-specific references still
in the game.  Many of these have been removed, including references that were
in screens.are.

------------------
Magma 3.02 Changes
------------------

There have not been any significant code changes.  However, the project files and
code have been updated to compile successfully in Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
on Windows and with GCC on Ubuntu Linux 6.06.

------------------
Magma 3.00 Changes
------------------
This is a new release with many changes.  They are too countless to list, brought
about by months of playtesting and actually running a MUD on the codebase.  This
distribution also marks the split where Magma is no longer directly associated
with Basternae, and is instead an independent codebase.  As such, changes in the
future are likely to make it more adaptable to different types of MUDs and things
are likely to be more configurable.  If I had to go back and renumber the versions,
this would be the "true" magma 1.00.  Since changes from this point on will be
made by only one maintainer, they will be much better documented.

------------------
Magma 2.01 Changes
------------------
Mud was locked to newbies when first run.  This has been changed.

------------------
Magma 2.00 Changes
------------------
The changes in this version of Magma are too numerous to be listed.  To see
a better list of the changes, run the MUD and type NEWS

------------------
Magma 1.00 Changes
------------------
A handful of bugs were fixed.

------------------
Magma 0.98 Changes
------------------
ANSI code improved.
A few various bugs and uglinesses fixed.

------------------
Magma 0.97 Changes
------------------
In order to rent you must now be in a room flagged "inn".
The do_give command now partially checks some quest stuff.
Fixed some color bleeding.
Trip and disarm checks for mobs have been removed from fight.c so that
  that can be handled by a mob's special functions.
Newbies now get food and water.

------------------
Magma 0.96 Changes
------------------
Fixed a pfile save/load bug that was caused by object affects and affected
  by having the same key.
Hit, mana, and move gain have faster, smoother ticks.  Rather than update
  hits mana and moves as one batch, they each have separate ticks which
  are at approximately 5 second intervals.

------------------
Magma 0.95 Changes
------------------
Items without costs now have more accurate costs set with the set_cost
  function which now takes into account craftsmanship and some stat info
  from weapons and armor.
Corpses now retain the player's name as one of they keywords, and carved
  items also retain the corpse's name.
A bug in the is_affected function has been fixed.
Mobs will no longer spam spelling themselves up with the same spells
  repeatedly.
Objects now load affect data, though this information is not yet
  transferred to the player when they wear/wield the object.

------------------
Magma 0.94 Changes
------------------
Shops now load properly, including the buy and sell multipliers.
The list looks a little cleaner and you can now purchase items.
Items without a value set have values autoset at load time.
The makezone program now adds .shp files to the .are files.

------------------
Magma 0.93 Changes
------------------
Basic fraglist was created to keep track of racewar pkills.

------------------
Magma 0.92 Changes
------------------
Will now let you reconnect instead of telling you that you are already
  playing.

------------------
Magma 0.91 Changes
------------------
Score screen redone.

------------------
Magma 0.90 Changes
------------------
Made a few changes to db.c for more DikuEdit compatibility.
Added the directions southwest, northwest, southeast, and northeast.

------------------
Magma 0.84 Changes
------------------
Added the ability for players to scribe spells from a mob flagged teacher.
  The player must have a quill in their hand and be the proper level.  A
  skill check of scribe determines the skill level they get that spell at.

------------------
Magma 0.83 Changes
------------------
Poses removed completely.  They may eventually be re-added.
A bug with memorize_update has been fixed.
Created the newbie_eq_char function in comm.c that gives a character
  random newbie equipment based on values defined in merc.h.
Pointer resets in the do_forget command have been fixed.

------------------
Magma 0.82 Changes
------------------
Implemented class_none as a default useless class.
Added spec_fun2 to mobiles for even more extra functions.
Spec_fun is automatically assigned to mob based on class.  If there is a
  spec_fun for that mob specified in the area file, it pushes the class
  spec_fun to spec_fun2 and puts the one in #SPECIALS in spec_fun, making
  it the primary (first checked) function.
Classes from DikuEdit now convert into as close as they have to
  equivalents in Magma.

------------------
Magma 0.81 Changes
------------------
Changed object extra flags so that they use bitvectors.  These flags can
  be accessed with the IS_OBJ_STAT, SET_OBJ_STAT, and REMOVE_OBJ_STAT
Added supporting code for some of the room bits.  Uncoded room bits are
  noted in merc.h.

------------------
Magma 0.80 Changes
------------------
Added and changed a bunch of bits in merc.h to make the code more DikuEdit
  compatible.
Deleted all of the stock areas, since the codebase has moved beyond being
  Envy-compatible.
More work has been done with spell memorization, but it is not quite
  right yet.  do_forget and memorize_update still need work.
Newbie equipment temporarily disabled until it is created (refers to old
  zone equipment and crashes MUD)
Item types are now prefixed by TYPE_ rather than ITEM_ because item
  affects were prefixed by ITEM_, thus making things quite confusing to
  poor old Xangis.
Little ANSI bug that would force players to have white as their foreground
  color has been smushed.

------------------
Magma 0.73 Changes
------------------
Animal-type mobs no longer carry gold coins.
The coin types copper, silver, and platinum have been added.  Most of the
  code has been converted to use all of these coin types.  The only
  exceptions are the do_steal and spec_thief functions, which reference
  gold only.
Added a bunch of mob specials.
Added a bunch of object specials.

------------------
Magma 0.72 Changes
------------------
The spell system has more development.  Memorization is now in a FIFO
  order and the memorize command functions works better.
Trophy code has been added, which keeps track of the kind and number of
  mobs that a player has killed and gives them less experience for
  killing the same things repeatedly.  The size of a player's trophy
  depends upon their level and trophy will not affect players until level
  5.

------------------
Magma 0.71 Changes
------------------
Spell memorization is now limited by class and level, you can only memorize
  a certain maximum number of spells.
Spells no longer have levels, but circles instead.  Players get spell
  circles at level 1 and every 5 levels after that.  There are 12 circles
  of spells, with 12 being immortal only.
More developements have been done on the spell system, and more to come.
A few spell system bugfixes.

------------------
Magma 0.70 Changes
------------------
Fixed the load_quests function's pointer assignments.
Added some memorization support for the upcoming spell system, namely
  the mem_data struct and the do_memorize, do_forget, do_meditate,
  and memorize_update functions.  All spellcasters except psionicists
  will have to memorize their spells before they can cast them.
  Psionicists will still be using the mana system.
The do_cast function has been modified to require that a spell be memmed
  before it can be cast unless the caster is an immortal.
The do_will function is identical to the old do_cast function and is used
  only for psionicists.
The 'stat memdata' command has been added to show the number of free and
  total memorization data in the game.

------------------
Magma 0.65 Changes
------------------
Implementation of events has begun.  More tick types have been created and
  each one has an associated event.  So far all this allows is the
  staggering of mobile, character, object, room, or other pulses.
The memory command now reports the size of each structure and how much
  memory is occupied by each structure.
Stripped some old color codes out of the help files.
Each race now has its own message when it enters or leaves the room.
  Ogres will lumber and Centaurs will trot.
The fee, feed, stake, and donate commands have been removed.
Whois, title, and where are now immortal only commands.
The sacrifice command has been removed.

------------------
Magma 0.64 Changes
------------------
Removed the weapon type from the spell_damage function since it needed it
  about as much as a fish needs a bicycle.
Added the ask command which is used to get quest messages from mobs
  primarily.
Added the petition and ptell commands, which allows mortals to address
  the group of immortals as a whole and be responded to in a godlike
  manner.
Added the consent command which allows you to give a player your
  permission for various upcoming things.
The sub-level gods Avatar (59), Immortal (60), and Demigod (61) have been
  added for those who want more immortal ranks.  They do not yet have any
  commands assigned to them.

------------------
Magma 0.63 Changes
------------------
Flee has been modified - you can now flee if you aren't fighting.  When
  you do flee you see which direction you went, as does your opponent,
  provided you are not sneaking.
The mud now loads DikuEdit quest (.qst) files.  We now have 100% DikuEdit
  load compatibility.  However, not all the data is understood by the MUD
  yet.  The do_ask command has to be added and the do_give command has to
  be modified before the MUD can process quests.
Another mudconfig option has been added allowing verbose logs of quest
  data loading messages, since quest data is very strict in its format
  and can cause problems.
A new immortal command, STAT QUEST has been added to show a basic list of
  the quests that are in the game.
In /test/area/convzone another file has been added, zonefromqst, which
  when run will create a zone file from a .qst file.  makezone has also
  been modified.

------------------
Magma 0.62 Changes
------------------
Removed more useless/disabled OLC code.
Added the basics of a menu.  Also added the rent command.  When you rent
  or quit, it will take you to the basics of a menu which is simply where
  you have the option to enter the game or quit.  Currently the rent and
  quit commands can be used from anywhere in the game.
When you die or are killed you go to the menu and have the option to
  quit or re-enter the game.
Disentegrate spell no longer totally destroys a character hit by it.

------------------
Magma 0.61 Changes
------------------
When players die, their stuff goes to their corpse.
Timers on corpses are longer.
Corpses now save when you die, so if the mud crashes or reboots you still
  have a chance of being able to retrieve items from your corpse.
Murder command has been removed.  You can now use kill on players.
Permenant death due to experience loss has been removed.


------------------
Magma 0.60 Changes
------------------
Removed the bulk of the OLC code, since Magma is designed to be used
  primarily with an offline editor.  Retaining the world save command
  for easy area format conversion.
Affect bits, affects, bitvectors were totally rewritten.  The affect bits
  are now structs that contain which byte they go with.  The constant
  NUM_AFFECT_VECTORS in merc.h determines how many bytes are to be used
  for affects -- this was done for ease of expansion, giving a virtually
  unlimited amount of available bits.
Several functions have been added to bit.c to handle the affect
  structures.
Made the damage for being in the sun a little more reasonable for the
  upcoming tick system.
A few bugfixes made from previous version.

------------------
Magma 0.51 Changes
------------------
Magma now has autoadvancing skills.  A player's skills will go up with use
  to a certain maximum dictated by their level.
Classes' skils changed a bit.

------------------
Magma 0.50 Changes
------------------
Removed a bunch of level code and level restriction stuff from objects.
Created the class_avail chart so races can be restricted to certain
classes.
Mobiles now also have attributes str, int, wis, dex, con, agi, cha, pow,
  and luk.  They may be set by mset and affected by spells and objects.
The train command has been removed.
Agility, charisma, power, and luck now shows on mstat.
Set body parts to be lopped off at the end of a fight 1/4 as often, since
  it just made a big ugly mess :P
After you die, you come back standing up rather than resting.
Skills and spells have been split into two.  Skills and spells are
  different enough that they should not be lumped together.  Since they
  have been split, special care should be taken to see that you use a
  spell function for a spell (i.e. spell_lookup) and a skill function for
  a skill (i.e. skill_lookup).  There are bound to be bugs in such a major
  conversion, but I hope to squish them before the code ever sees the
  light of day.  By splitting the spells and skills, neither is limited
  by the other in any way, and they can be customized and expanded as
  necessary.
Because skills and spells have been split, the affect_data has both
  a variable for the skill and spell.  Only one of these should ever
  be set at a time.
Removed 18 immortal commands and combined them into the commands find,
  load, set, stat, and where.  The commands are otherwise unchanged.
Added the news command to access help news
The structure used for skills has been trimmed down and the variables
  that were only used for spells have been removed.
Added the Neogi mob race.
The spells structures no longer hold the actual position needed to cast
  a spell since it is either standing or fighting that you need to be.
  The value was changed do cast_combat, which is TRUE if you can cast
  it in battle and FALSE if you can't.

------------------
Magma 0.42 Changes
------------------
Added Zen's name ban code to make banning of unwanted names easier.
Added twenty-six races.
Prompt now defaults to Basternae-style prompt, with additional option
  of "Prompt Meter" for life meters rather than status.
Now saves the game time in /sys/SYSDATA.TXT.  Game time is saved every
  15 minutes.  Was getting Groundhog Day flashbacks from living the same
  day over and over...

------------------
Magma 0.41 Changes
------------------
Eliminated the light, shield, hold, missile weapon, wield, and wield2
  equipment locations and set up hand and hand2 wear locations.  These
  wear locations have not been fully debugged yet.
Added wear locations eyes, face, left and right ear, quiver, badge,
  on back, attached to belt.
Added the exp command
Sentinel mobs will no longer spam repop.
Changed the stat system to be based on 100 points rather than 18.
Changed constitution to be a percentage multiplier rather than a flat
  bonus.
Racial stat maximums are now defined in const.c rather than the bonuses
  and penalties.  When your race changes, your stats change dynamically,
  since your stat values are stored as percentile values.
Added the firstaid command, usable on self for a small hitpoint gain,
  once per game day.

------------------
Magma 0.40 Changes
------------------
Added definitions for object extra2 flags and object anti flags.
ITEM_VIS_DEATH, ITEM_VAMPIRE_BANE, ITEM_DARK, ITEM_LOCK removed because
  they either served no purpose or duplicated some of the new bits.
Material type definitions added.  Material type is fully functional, but
  no code takes into account material types as of yet.
Object size now functional.
Now loads Basternae format mobiles.  Flags for mobiles have not been coded
  yet.
Now loads Basternae format reset (.zon) files.
Now loads Basternae format shop (.shp) files.
Updated /area/convzone/makezone, created /area/convzone/zonefrommob.
Fixed some color bleeding.
Command aliases: skills = slist, attributes = score.

------------------
Magma 0.33 Changes
------------------
Added fall chance, mana, and current to room loads.  Data for mana and
  current is discarded for now.  Fall chance data is used.  .wld files
  are now fully Basternae compatible.
Now loads Basternae format objects.  This has not been thoroughly tested
  yet and support for the anti_flags, anti_flags2, extra_flags2, size,
  material, volume, and craftsmanship values has not yet been added.
New utility on /area/convzone called zonefromobj that creates a zone
  from an object file.  /area/convzone/makezone takes the .obj and .wld
  file from a zone and makes an area out of it.

------------------
Magma 0.32 Changes
------------------
Display is now an alias for prompt command
Mindflayers had been renamed to Illithids and Hobbits to halflings, but
  the mob races in the zones had not been changed, would give mob wrong
  race and put an error message in the log.  Changed them in the areas.
  also Halfdwarf to Half-Dwarf and Halfelf to Half-Elf.
The convzone program (in /area/convzone) has been written to combine
  Basternae and Duris-style areas into a single .are file.  The zones
  will not yet load, since support for the format has not been added.
  For now this program is primarily used to make coding support for
  these zones easier.
.WLD files from the Duris/Basternae format can be converted into entire
  room-only zones by running the zonefromwld file in /area/convzone.
  This will convert the .wld file into a usable .are file.  The .are
  file will have no header, so that will have to be added manually.
Added 15 sector types in order to support the additional sector types
  in the Basternae zone format.  Some more code may be needed in the
  move_char function in order to support all functions of the new sector
  types
Added all of the flags needed for Basternae room flag compatibility.
  The flags are not yet handled by the code and the old zones' flags
  do not yet convert correctly.  Flags not yet handled are listed in
  merc.h and show up as not yet imped when a room is statted.
Added code to support the no_heal, heal, no_scan, twilight, magicdark,
  magiclight, and no_gate room flags.
OLC saving will save rooms with the #BASTROOMS in order to keep the new
  room flags intact.  All of the stock areas have already been converted.

------------------
Magma 0.31 Changes
------------------
More color
Increased number of saving throw types to five, even though only the
  spell save is currently used.
Added a color field to race definitions
Who now shows a player's race and a player's race is indicated when you
  see them in a room.
Now tells you which direction someone enters the room from.
No exp penalty for fleeing.
Added the options for display of player status, tank status, and enemy
  status in the prompt.  These can be displayed as meters or text.
A few minor updates to the help file.

------------------
Magma 0.30 Changes
------------------
Added ability scores for Agility, Charisma, Power, and Luck to creatures
  and players
Ability scores can now vary from the 13 and 16 that are set by default.
Agility affects AC rather than dexterity now.
This is the first version that has any file incompatibilities -- the
  pfiles from UltraEnvy will not have the four new ability scores so
  they will default to zero.

------------------
Magma 0.23 Changes
------------------
Removed everything involving registering to be a pkiller, including the
  PLR_REGISTER flag, the do_register function, and check_registered
  function.
Moves and mana now change colors on the prompt as they get low.
In order to make character creation and logging in quicker and easier,
  the connected states have been modified and the second title scren has
  been removed.  You now have to hit enter fewer times to create a
  character.

------------------
Magma 0.22 Changes
------------------
More color
Doors now show up on the autoexit list and exits command.
Immortals now show up at the top of the who list.
Newbie equipment is no longer called 'sub issue' stuff, and players no
  longer start in newbie school.
Took away the majority of the penalties and restrictions on pkilling,
  such as the EXP and EQ loss and shopkeepers not selling to you.  The
  MUD does still keep track of killer flags, however.  This creates a
  rudimentary form of justice where you will get your ass kicked for
  being a killer if there are any mobs around flagged with either the
  spec_guard or spec_executioner procs.  The killer flag is removed when
  you die.
Purgatory has been removed from the game entirely.
"Me" is now another alias for yourself.
When you die it now tells you what you have been killed by.
  i.e. "You have been slain by a cityguard!"

-----------------
Magma 0.21 Changes
-----------------
More color
Hitpoint prompt now changes color depending upon a player's injuries
Sacrifice is no longer a mortal command and does not give coins.
No longer tells you how many experience points you get for a kill.
Removed all title_table related stuff (class and level based titles)
Changed immortal names to overlord, implementor, greater god, lesser god
  (Listed in descending order)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Code changes to UltraEnvy 0.87j done by Veygoth for Magma 0.20
--------------------------------------------------------------
Can save at level one.
No choice of neuter at menu.
Added Duris style color codes in merc.c and act_comm.c
  Added support for bold foreground colors
Removed the conv_braces and unconv_braces functions from db.c
  since they were no longer needed (color problems caused the need for
  them)
Removed all of the Lope-style color codes from the code files.
Added Duris color codes to a few strings.
Removed experience penalty for fleeing combat.
Removed the AUTOLOOT, AUTOSAC, and AUTOGOLD code.
Toggle is now an alias for config.
