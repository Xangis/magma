Much work has gone into the creation of Magma.  Over the years, many people
have contributed to the work, whether they know it or not.  They deserve
credit for all of their time and hard work, and credit shall be given.

Thanks to everyone for their help and input with the Magma codebase.  If your
name was left out and you think it should be included, email me and I'll add
you to the credits for the next release.

Credits regarding Magma up to version 3.00:
-------------------------------------------
The majority of changes have been done by Xangis (Jason Champion a.k.a Veygoth).

Significant code contributions have been made by Lohrr and Lithos.

Additional code contributions have been made by Govno, Ski, Thendar, Sniktiorg,
Timken, Saeven, and Jolle.

Much of the in-game help has been written by Ski.

Thendar did a vast amount of zone work for the original Basternae.  Though not
much of her work is reflected in this distribution, the vast amount of testing
and bugfinding she has done has helped to improve and fix quite a lot.

Magma was written both as an independent distribution and for the rebuild of
Basternae 2.  Nearly all of the credits for Basternae 2 apply to Magma.
