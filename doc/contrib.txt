and i'll fix it in the next release.



=== Information

Almost all of the features of UltraEnvy were heavily based on work done by
someone else, so they are who deserve your credits not me. I mostly limited
myself to porting the code to the Envy 2.2 code base, fixing bugs, and
occasionally rewriting some code. I wrote some details to the porting work
bellow so you can use them for your reference.

Mythran 3.1.11:	Only looked at Mythran code after i released 0.85. They had
		  already made most of features i later coded/ported myself
		  to Envy 2.2 so i felt a bit pissed ;-) Just in time! I was
		  going to port WIZNET and this saved lots of hassle...
		Plague spell, Cure disease spell, flower social, Seven dice
		game, High dice game, WIZNET, #GAMES support code was also based
		on this codebase.

ROM 2.4:	ITEM_PORTAL, ITEM_WARP_STONE idea
		  (Made code from scratch for Envy2.2 - Zen)
		Spell "nexus", "portal" idea (Most of the code was rewritten)
		IRV flags system idea & some 40% of it's code.
		ROM is a nice code base. It has some very nice features like:
		ITEM_FURNITURE, different damage types, wiznet (this is a must),
		affects like render a char invisible by just wearing an object,
		smarter mobs, etc.

		A couple of functions were also taken from SMAUG code.
		SMAUG is a great code base. I highly advise you to look at SMAUG
		unless you're totally addicted to a mud type, like i'm addicted
		to Envy :-) It has loads of features, spells/skills.

		HIT_FUN's, improved weather system, ranged weapons, weapon
		proficiencies, gems, mana types & ridable mobs code was based on
		this one.  Also know as NiMUD.  Great dual hand system.
		Btw i tried to contact Locke about this release at the address
		below but all my email bounced back.
