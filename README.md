Magma MUD - An old-school MUD codebase derived from DIKU, Merc, Envy, and
UltraEnvy that runs on Windows and Linux.

It is written in C and runs on Windows or Linux.  Check the files in /doc for
the various licenses that apply (there are a bunch -- this has inherited from
a long branch of the DIKU MUD family tree).

Documentation is in the /doc directory. Start with README.TXT and go from there.

Source code is in the /src directory. To build on a standard Linux system, run
"make std". To build on Windows, open MagmaMUD.sln with Visual Studio and build.

This codebase was used as the base for Basternae II: Phoenix Rising MUD.
There is a Basternae 3 MUD currently running, but it does not use this code,
but rather a new codebase written using C# .NET.

For Basternae 3, please visit http://basternae.org

## Development Status

Magma is not currently under active development, but I do make changes to it from
time to time to ensure that it can be built on a modern system.

I am willing to accept pull requests if you have improvements to contribute.
