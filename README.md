Magma MUD - An old-school MUD codebase derived from DIKU, Merc, Envy, and
UltraEnvy

It is written in C and runs on Windows or Linux.  Check the files in /doc for
the various licenses that apply (there are a bunch -- this has inherited from
a long branch of the DIKU MUD family tree).

This codebase was used as the base for Basternae II: Phoenix Rising MUD.
There is a Basternae 3 MUD currently running, but it does not use this code,
but rather a new codebase written using C# .NET.
