Disseminating through the air is the stench of too many woks of fried rice

Master Chef Mephi. In this awe-inspiring apartment, you find yourself amazed
at the incredible mess of CD's in one corner and the BusinessWeek pile. In
the middle of the room is a hand-me-down sofa-bed from Mephi's older sister,
Rochelle. Have a seat, turn on the radio, flip on the T.V., and just relax...
you'll have to wait a while before Mephi gets back!

The Porch~
A gentle breeze stirs the air with the smell of fresh dew on the grass.  It
is late at night and various insects can be heard buzzing and chirping, but 
a small light allows you to see the details of this place.  You are on a 
small porch where time has been frozen in that moment where you can sit back 
and enjoy nature during the peak of Summer.  A swing gently sways in the 
breeze.  Rose bushes can be seen through the screen wire stretched between 
boards which form window-like squares on three sides of the room.

This is a cylindrical room, about 20 feet across and 10 feet high.  The
floor, the walls, even the ceiling are covered in a very soft, tan
carpeting.  Woven into the carpeting on the walls are murals depicting
dozens of feline species.  On one side of the room is a small jacuzzi,
bubbling merrily, and directly opposite it is a circular depression filled
with colorful, bouncy pillows.  The room is lit by a warm glow that doesn't
seem to have a source.  There is a small alcove to the west.

An Alcove~
This is a small alcove leading off from Katrina's Playpen.  You can see the
happy atmosphere of the playpen back to the east, and a glowing circle of
light on the ceiling.

The Abyss~
You are deafened by the screams of the insane tortured souls who are utterly
condemned to suffer eternally due to their displeasing of the Gods.  Chaos is
the only predictable feature in the Abyss.  You hope and pray that you can
escape this nightmare.  You look frantically for an exit and find....
THERE ARE NONE! YOU ARE UTTERLY DAMNED!

The Burning Shrine~
You are standing in a very dark room, only lit by the light of a darkly
burning altar. Everything except the gleaming black marble floor seems to
be made from searing flames. Somehow, even though  the room is filled
with fire, the flames emanate utter cold instead of heat. You realize
that it  might not have been such a good idea to come here.

The Dark Flame burns here mysteriously.

Smoof's bedroom~
     This is a large room with two beds in it. You see Snoopy, 
Smoof's dog, standing on the bed staring at you. Smoof's bird, 
Angel, is chirping at you. You see his Pentium 75 Mhz sitting 
in a corner. You also see his TV sitting on a desk in another 
corner.

You can leave north through the door into the bathroom.

Horizon~
White clouds speed past, in the air above, and a wind is constantly
blowing.  The endless sky stretches into infinity, with nothing marking
the dark plain below it except a lone, solitary throne that mars its
desolation.  You are overcome by an overwhelming feeling of smallness,
as you gaze into the forever sunset; the pale orb sits, unmoving,  a 
finger's width above the west horizon - and you get the impression that
time itself has slowed to a stop.

The Hideout~
You are in a small, circular room.  There is no floor, only a 
wall-to-wall bed that feels VERY comfortable.  Pillows are scattered
around on the bed in varying sizes and shapes; for pillow fights,
obviously!  Come to think of it... there are no walls either - just
one big display screen surrounding the bed!   You can probably
conjure up images on the screen somehow  for observation purposes.
There is a control panel attached to the ceiling, and an exit
hatchway up there too.
   What a hideout!

A secure hatchway that reminds you of an airlock door in a submarine,

screen wall view display viewscreen~
Right now there are several different images on the screen : One is of
the temple altar, where people are sleeping and putting things in the
pit (boring)...  An other shows a sleeping dragon, and a foolish
adventurer trying to sneak by him. Heh heh, looks like that dragon is
about to wake up too!...  Another image is of a female adventurer...
undressing?!  ULP!  Obviously the owner of this room is a skank!
Sheesh....  There is one picture that shows what appears to be a 
still-life view of the forest west of Midgaard, until movement in one
corner alerts you to the presence of a small bunny hopping around
idly...  Near the top of the screen is a computer readout listing the
purchases/sells of various shopkeepers, and a perpetually updating list
of adventurers now present in the world.  You wonder how to change the
pretty pictures...  ~
E
readout shopkeepers purchases sells~
Apparently the weaponsmith just sold a Sun Sword, and bought a standard
issue mace in the last 5 minutes.  The armourer apparently hasn't had
any business recently.  Igor in New Thalos hasn't has a new buy in
several days, and Elvira isn't MAKING ANY PROFIT!~
E
adventurers list people~
There are a lot of adventurers in the world right now, but each has his
updated stats and eq listed on this viewscreen.  Aren't they lucky.  You
pick out your own and gasp when you realize that you have something you
didn't know you had!~
E
control panel controls ~
This is the controller of everything that this room can do.  There are
rows of buttons for you to push!  Whee!  Some of the buttons you pick
out immediately are labeled : view of central square, slay character,
summon monster, EJECT,  adjust prices, summon player, view of smurf
village, spy, release drones, change players sex, disengage, travel to
destination...  Cool stuff!  You see buttons for ordering food, for
controlling monsters, and for setting items!  There's a whole portion
devoted to the running of quests (with such commands as, execute quest,
load quest item, etc....) and the distribution of justice.  You 
accidentally push the 'self destruct' button... 
tick.  tick.  tick.  tick.  UH OH. ~

Alexander's private enclave~
     You are standing in a large room, the top of a tower or castle keep you'd
assume.  However, you know not how you got here, other then that you must
have had an appointment or a reason to speak to lord Alexander.  There are
luxurious chairs surrounding a huge fireplace, be careful not to upset Tara
the wonder cat.  There is a doorway leading south into the private sleeping
chambers, and to the west lies a laboratory of sorts.

if it hasn't been slept in recently.  Near the bed is a large shelf full of
books of all sorts.  Dusty tomes line the walls, glowing softly as the eerie
firelight dances among the shadows.
The only exit leads back to the main chamber.

various bottles of reagents.  In the center of the room is a large marble
table.  The table currently houses various tomes and beakers.  It appears
that our Lord is experimenting with some sort of matter.  I wouldn't touch
it if I was you...

Wyrmclaw's Council of War Room~
    You find yourself in the massive hall of a great stone castle.  In the 
center of the room is a large round oak table surrounded by noble lords dressed
in armor.  There is much discussion about a possible invasion and war.  At the
head of the table you see a slight woman sitting quietly.  She is dressed in a 
fine gown of emerald silk and atop her head is a golden crown.  This is the
castle of Lord Wyrmclaw and the Knights of the Crystal Rose.  The woman is his
loving wife, Lady Jessica Quechard.

There is only one exit from this room, the door you came in through.
