You may use these color escapes in any string which is shown with the 'act' or
'send_to_char' functions.  This includes anything that is in an area file.

== Foreground colors

&+l	for black foreground (don't use - nobody can see it)
&+r	for red foreground
&+g	for green foreground
&+y	for orange (or brown) foreground
&+b	for blue foreground
&+m	for purple foreground
&+c	for cyan foreground
&+w	for white (or gray) foreground
&+L	for dark grey foreground
&+R	for bright red/pink foreground
&+G	for bright green foreground
&+Y	for yellow foreground
&+B	for bright blue foreground
&+M	for bright purple foreground
&+C	for bright cyan foreground
&+W	for bright white foreground

=== Other color codes

There are other color codes for background colors, but those have not yet
been added (mainly due to laziness).  I will get around to adding them
eventually.

=== Color resets

&n or &N will reset color to the default color, which on most terminals
will be white.  These reset codes should be used at the end of a string to
prevent color bleeding.  Any act strings in the source code that include
things like $p and $N should have &n placed immediately following them in
order to prevent color bleeding.  Color bleeding, in case you don't know,
is when text that is supposed to be white or the default color is the last
color used instead.  It looks tacky.

=== Old color codes

I have not yet removed all of the old color codes, which are started with
the { symbol instead of the & symbol.  If you see them, go ahead and
remove them.  Otherwise things may look a little tacky...
