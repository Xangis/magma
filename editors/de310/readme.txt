    This file contains the basic information you need to use dikuEdit -
    read on and enjoy.

    Loading/creating zones -

      Just type "DE <zonename>" at a command prompt.  If the .WLD, .ZON, .OBJ,
      or .MOB files don't exist, they will be created, do not fear.  All is
      good.

    Getting acquainted quickly -

      To see the wonderful options DikuEdit has to offer, try typing
      "config," "disp," and "checkc" within the editor.

      A brief command list can be viewed by typing "?"; to see a more
      detailed command list, type "HELP".  You can see a complete list
      of all commands by typing "COMMANDS" (alas, this list has no
      categorization or general help).

      If you don't want to read through the command list in DE.TXT
      command-by-command in order to figure out the arguments and what
      order they go in, try typing the command name and then gibberish
      for arguments at the prompt; most commands should let you know their
      syntax.

    Finally, there are some things in dikuEdit that are not obvious,
    but that can help things along immensely.  Thus, the docs (DE.TXT)
    are probably required reading, in the end.

    This version of DikuEdit was originally written by Michael Glosenger
    (Tavril) and is now maintained by the Magma staff.
