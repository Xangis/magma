=== EVENTS

What the heck are events anyway?

Events are basically little timers that tell certain things to happen at
certain points.  This initial implementation of events is a little basic,
allowing just the standard tick events to be modified by changing the
PULSE_WHATEVER definitions in merc.h.  What this does is allow for
staggered character, object, mobile, or other update times, this making
the MUD run a little more smoothly.

As the event code develops further, I plan on using the event system to
control room procedures, time delay functions, multiple round spells, and
many other things.
