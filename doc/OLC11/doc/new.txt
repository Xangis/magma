=== Changes for Envy2.2 & UltraEnvy:

Please see 'new.txt' in the 'newdocs' directory, this file here should be very
out of date. I sometimes do bugfixes which don't go there also, but that's life!

ILAB OLC Beta 1.1 For Envy2.0
25th June 1997

Christopher Smith	stoked@iastate.edu


=== Changes for Envy2.0:

	Lots of porting - reset_room, etc :)
	Removed number_fuzzy in load_mobiles() to keep Mobiles at constant level
	Added table race_flags to bit.c and improved medit to edit mob races
	Removed the race_flags table and created a new function race_full_lookup
	Fixed many small bugs, like do_mstat, fwrite_char
	Changed AREA_VERBOSE to 8, not 5...  Mind wasn't cooperating
	Fixed bust_a_prompt to check descriptors to avoid switched players
	Fixed bust_a_prompt to include both %c and %C options (name and number)
	Changed medit_shop delete to Erwin's suggestion
	Hopefully fixed reset editing due to Mythran example?
	Created a TEMP_CONE_OF_SILENCE flag, so real CONE_OF_SILENCE will save,
	  and the TEMP one won't.
	oedit_addaffect checks if flag_value is NO_FLAG first.
	oedit_weight and cost can't set negatives anymore
	added a snippit in the install/options directory for those players
	  who want to use the help editor (hedit), including a new home-brewed
	  function by yours truly.

ILAB OLC Beta 1.0 For Envy1.0
7th April 1995

Jason Dinkel	jdinkel@mines.colorado.edu


=== What's new in ILAB OLC Beta 1.1 For Envy1.0:

These are some of the changes that I have made to this version of OLC.
Notice that I will not be keeping a running tally of repairs I have
made.  I will only include changes that have been made since the last
version I released.

	When removing the last builder from the list, he is replaced by "None".
	Many superfluous functions were removed.
	NULL removed to keep code looking Envy-esque.
	Memory problems fixed. (str_dup used in create_mob/obj)
	Resets now show just those in the room.
	Randomized exits allowed.
	Multiple flags may be entered on one line.  Thanks Russ Taylor.
	Vnum range is syntax checked.
	Minimal filename syntax checking.
	Table lookup for spec_funs and stats and flags.
	New display format for all editors.
	Fix to close_socket by Talen added, then removed again when code
	  revised.
	Table lookup for commands.
	Command dump of editor commands to user added.
	Fixed the Who command, now it displays editing characters, then removed
	  again when code revised.
	Added C flag to complement c flag for prompts by showing vnum being
	  edited.
	Used new table format to display current flags, stats, spells,
	  special functions.
	Rewrote help.
	Save routines now check for builder authorization and asave area, for
	  example, finds the area of the currently edited object/mobile and
	  saves only that area.  Before it would save the area that the player
	  was physically standing in even if editing in another area at that
	  time.
	Editing no longer crashes game when it becomes too large.
	Used last line skipping(as in CircleMUD) instead of truncation.
	Ensured that strings entered via the editor cannot have '~' in them.
	Revised security levels, now 0 is lowest, and there in no upper limit.
	Areas are loaded with a security of 1 if they don't have a security
	  value set.  This means that beginning players (security=0) will not
	  be able to edit them.
	Objects can be created and get saved in player files and still be
	  loaded even if the database doesn't get saved.
	Fix all d->connected checks.  By changing the configuration of
	  olc this became unnecessary.  Connected states for editors are now
	  internalized.
	Tilde no longer used in SEdit.  Smash_tilde() called at the beginning
	  if string_add so that .r "hello" "he~lo" is not allowed.  Thanks to
	  James Seng for noticing this.
	Removed the light command for rooms because it isn't saved in the
	  database.
	List "key" etc for just working area.
	List mob <shop>, <spec (spec_name)>, <level (#)>, <name (name)>
          <sex (letter)>, <align (number)>
	List obj <type (? types)>, <name (name)>
	List room


	Changed string_add() function in string.c. New function is cleaned up
	  and removes problem with editing strings longer than
	  MAX_STRING_LENGTH.
	Added check for strings longer than MAX_STRING_LENGTH to
	  format_string().  Calling functions should check for problems.
	  Ones I modified were: redit_ed(), redit_format(), and oedit_ed().
	Function do_olc() was removed.  Functions do_aedit(), do_redit(),
	  do_oedit(), and do_medit() are all called from interp.c directly.
	  Help file was updated with the new calls. Prototypes moved from olc.h
	  to merc.h. This was a personal preference of mine.
	The AIX compiling system causes the following to get flagged:
	  spec_table[cmd].spec_fun[0] != '\0'. I've changed these to:
	  *spec_table[cmd].spec_fun in flag_string(), flag_lookup(),
	  spec_string(), spec_lookup(), show_flag_cmds(), show_spec_cmds(),
	  and show_help().
	Area flags all set to FALSE so they cannot be changed.
	EXIT_BASHED set to FALSE so closed + bashed doors cannot be made.
	  To create a bashed door you can just make it open and describe it as
	  bashed.
	Aedit_create() used to return FALSE when it created an area.  Sorry.
	Vnum maxes were coded in to ensure that vnum doesn't exceed INT_MAX.
	Player can no longer log in as "none" and edit areas. Thanks Walker.
	Reset randomization not supported in this version. All calls to
	  orig_door have been removed.
	Function new_load_rooms() was added.  This loads rooms that have
	  #ROOMDATA as the keyword.  These rooms have the door bits set by OLC.
	  This includes the door resets.
	In save_rooms() there were a couple changes.
	  a) Exits are saved even if they have to_room = NULL.
	  b) New format(#ROOMDATA) saves the 'D' reset data into the locks bit.
	  c) Used area vnum range as the counter because it is much faster.
	  Profiling information available upon request.
	Removed sex flag "none".
	Door bits are now loaded correctly into pExit->rs_flags by
	  load_resets().
	Changes to reset_room(): Containers get reset to original states.
	  Randomizations of the doors was commented out.
	Function change_exit() was rewritten.  It no longer supports movement
	  commands.  This ensures that the builder gets syntax information if
	  mistyping.  Added "remove" command to remove keys or keywords or
	  descriptions without erasing the exit.
	WALK <dir> command was added to complement the previous change.
	Function save_resets() accidentally assigned pRoom while in a loop using
	  pRoom for both the O and the R resets.  This may have caused duplicate
	  resets or skipped resets.
	Because door resets are saved in the ROOMDATA section of area files now,
	  we no longer need function save_door_resets().
	New VERBOSE code was written by Rac.  Check it out!
	VERBOSE code separated into functions and verbose can be specified
	  inside the game to get a readable copy of your area.  Syntax is like:
	  asave area verbose.  Added AREA_VERBOSE flag.
	Changed from *EDIT( *edit_function ) to bool *edit_function ( blah )
	  because ctags for NeXT and ULTRIX doesn't support #define macros to
	  lookup functions.  Every function in act_olc.c was changed.
	Flags are checked after commands now in *edit() functions.  I
	  corrected some inconsistencies in the original flag code from
	  The Isles 1.1 in the process.
	Search tables were modified for each of the *edit interpreters.
	  look at the code to see what changed.
	Added automatic database saving.  Look for PULSE_DB_DUMP in merc.h. It
	  is currently set to 30 minutes.  You can choose what is necessary for
	  your computer.  The database is also saved before shutdown by the
	  time_update() routine.


I wasn't able to get to these features, or I had trouble with them on
certain operating systems.

Database syntax checking - I posted the corrections. They are accurate, but I
didn't include the code with this version because I thought it would just
complicate installation for people. I will post it as a module soon.

	Copy commands for mobiles and objects.
	Renumbering areas.
	Unlinking areas.
	Protection from teleportation to construction areas.


=== Note

I don't have a good list made up of things I need to fix or add.  If
there are any suggestions then I would be happy to add them to this list.
