=== Classes

The central organizing table for classes is class_table, which is an array of
type 'struct class_type' (defined in 'merc.h') and is defined in a class file
located on area/classes.

The fields of class_table are:

    char *	name;

	This is the full name of the class used for the 'who', 'whois' and
	'score' listings.

    char *	who_name;

	It's also used for the list of classes shown to new characters for
	selecting a class, and for matching the player's input in selecting a
	class.

    int 	attr_prime;

	This attribute is initialized to 16 for new chars of this class.  It
	costs only three practices to train one's prime attribute, versus five
	practices for any other attribute.  In addition, characters may
	increase their prime attribute (only) over 18 by using magic items.

    int 	weapon;

	This object (vnum) is given to new characters of this class for their
	first weapon.

    int 	guild;

	This room (vnum) is off limits to characters of other classes.

    int 	skill_adept;

	This is the maximum level to which a character of this class may train
	a skill or spell.

    int 	thac0_00;		/* Thac0 for level  0		*/
    int 	thac0_47;		/* Thac0 for level 47		*/

	These are thac0's (To Hit Armor Class 0) for a level 0 character and a
	level 47 character of this class.  Thac0 for any particular level is
	computed by linear interpolation.

    int 	hp_min;			/* Min hp gained on leveling	*/
    int 	hp_max;			/* Max hp gained on leveling	*/
    bool	fMana;			/* Class gains mana on level	*/

	The fields hp_min and hp_max are the minimum and maximum hit points
	gained on advancing a level (in addition to the constitution bonus).
	If fMana is true, than the class gains mana when leveling.


=== Adding, removing, and changing classes, the Magma way ===

Adding, removing, and changing classes in Magma isn't quite just as simple as
changing the CLASSES.LST file to add more classes.  There are a few in-code
things that have to be done:

const.c         - Edit repop_point structure to set race/class repop points.
                - Edit class_avail structure to set race/class availability.
merc.h          - Edit numbers assigned to each class, i.e. CLASS_WARRIOR
                - Edit MAX_CLASS to reflect the number of classes available.
                  Numbering starts at 0.

Classes do not have to load in any particular order, but every class number
must be filled and there must be no duplicates.  This will cause all manner
of problems and crashes.

Adding classes is more complex if you want new spells and skills, but it is
very easy to add a class reusing existing spells and skills.

For new classes, you may want to edit spec_mob.c and create a new AI
function for that class.  The easiest way is to copy a similar class and
change the name and behaviours.

It is also a good idea to add any information on this new class to help.are
so players have some clue what the class is all about.  This help file will
also be displayed during character generation.

The addition of a class can be a fairly tedious process, but it has been
improved and streamlined greatly since the days of Diku.  It can still be
further simplified, and that will come in time.  Much of this simplification
can be attributed to the work of Vasco Costa (Zen).  After reading how
complicated class addition is in Diku/Merc/Envy be sure to thank him for his
efforts.

=== Immortal Levels

Mortals may advance as high as level 50, though this is configurable with
the MAX_MORTAL_ADVANCE definition in merc.h.  Obviously you would not want
mortals to advance into a level that would be considered an immortal level,
unless of course you wanted your MUD to function that way.  The original
design allows for 50 levels, with levels up to 56 being levels that are
either granted by immortals or earned by attaining potions that advance
you to the next level.  This scheme makes for some interesting quest
possibilities at the higher levels of advancement.

The immortal levels are Builder, Avatar, Immortal, Demigod, Lesser God,
Greater God, Implementor, and Overlord at levels 58 - 65.  Because immortal
commands were rewritten as skills, simply being a Junior does not mean that
you will automatically have access to all immortal commands at that level.
Instead, the commands are assigned by the Implementor Director, based on both
level and group, which is one of Builder, Coder, or Implementor.  See 
cmd_table[] in interp.c or skill_table[] in const.c for the minimum level
necessary to use these commands.
