This is not part of the install. I started writing it and
found it to be taking too much time.  You can add it and
try to improve it.

It needs to still have the following attributes:
1) Remove resets associated with these exits.
2) Check that a path still exists to any areas that this
   area connects to.  (Use graph.c modified from circleMUD
   that I released a while back)
3) Remove resets not in this area that refer to mobiles
   and objects that are part of this area.
