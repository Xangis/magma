=== Considered features:

	Change those crazy door bits so we don't have a 3 page case statement.
	Rewrite save routines to take advantage of vnum ranges.
	Use the next of the pExit structure to save room exits, or remove it.
	Ensure that orig_doors is set when doors are changed.
	It is interesting to note that spamming while editing strings does not
	  result in a player quitting.
	Automatic database saving.
	Player houses.
	Other editors. - Talen's help editor included as tutorial.
	Renumber areas option - I give up.
	Unlink area option - Simple version included as tutorial.
	Builder motd.
	Copy command for objects and mobiles.


=== Not considered:

	delete option - don't like this idea for 2 reasons:
	  1) if 2 players are editing same object and one deletes it the other
	      will be pissed!
	  2) Deleting stuff can be dangerous if you want it back.

	Ensure mob/obj/room/area not editable by more than one player
	  simultaneously.  This is unnecessary and I can't see a way that it
	  could cause a crash.  Players assigned to the same area by the imp
	  should coordinate their efforts.
