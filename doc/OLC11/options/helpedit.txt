Notes for installing Talen's Help Editor.
=========================================

NOTE (Envy 2.0):
In addition to these steps, drop the save_help_are function into olc.c,
before do_asave, so you can add the asave helps option.  You'll need
to read the notes at the bottom of that file too.  Note that this function
saves ALL helps, so get rid of all references to olc.hlp, then append
that file to help.are and take it out of your AREA.LST file (offline),
and any #HELPS defined in specific areas (add those to help.are too)
