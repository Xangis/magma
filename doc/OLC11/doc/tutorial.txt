=== Tutorials - Installing a new interpreter

If you are interested in how to add a new interpreter to the OLC system
then you are reading the correct file.

This tutorial will step you through the creation of an interpreter that
will allow editing of help files.  Talen of Vego wrote the interpreter
originally and I have modified it to work with this new system.
